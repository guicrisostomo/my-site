As for my professional life, I work with React, along with tools such as TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn, Redux, React Forms, Zod. I have already worked on creating websites according to figma; viewing and sending images and other documents to the API; creating graphics through the data obtained by the back-end; creating sessions using cookies with JWT standard; sending authorization tokens to the API. I have always loved challenges and solving problems (things that made me like the IT area a lot)! As for my personal life, I love to code in my spare time, play on the console/PC, watch series and chat with friends. I am good at working in a team and I am proactive!",
